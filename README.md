# Conways Game of Life in Python

# Description
This project was made as a school project in 12th grade for my computer science class.

First time using python for a bigger project so this code might not be as organized as it should be!

Grade received: ~**TBA**~
# Requirements
This project uses [pysdl2](https://pypi.org/project/PySDL2/) a python wrapper for the C++ SDL2 library.

# Installing
Get [pysdl2](https://pypi.org/project/PySDL2/) <br>
```pip install -U pysdl2``` <br>

Now we need the SDL2 dlls: <br>

```pip install pysdl2-dll```
